xprintf("<format string>", val1, val2);

prints the format string with any format specifiers replaced with this
corresponding formatted value.

%d is for decimal, %c is character, %u unsigned decimal numbers
%s is for string, strings for c-strings

C strings are sequences of char (1 byte each)

followed by a byte, and its called a null terminator -> "\0"

C strings are often created as char arrays 

char msg[] = "Hello World";
char msg2[] = {'H', 'e', 'l','l','o','W','o','r','l','d','!', '\0'};

strlen - returns # of characters up to (not including) null terminator
